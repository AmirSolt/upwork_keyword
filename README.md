Use this library to extract simple stats from a keyword on upwork, and update the results.

For legal and simplicity we are not scraping data. To use this library properly:

1. login to your account 
2. search any keyword on the jobs section
3. copy the html from inspect* page
4. create an html file in "pages" folder 
5. run main.py

You can have as many files as you want


* make sure you copy the html from inspect page after keyword search not from the source
